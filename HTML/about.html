			<p> I'm a wedding and portrait photographer.Basically, I take pictures of people.
				I focus on non-models and capture regular people in wedding day situations that highlight an aspect of who they are.<br> To me photography is about people being real and then letting me paint a picture of that moment to remember it forever. 
				This is the story that matters most: real people, real stories, real moments.
				I am based in Dublin but travel for weddings all over Ireland.
